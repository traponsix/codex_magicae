            <h2>The project</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I still need to choose a name for this gdr, but it's my own vision of tabletop RPG's, 
                like dungeon's and dragons, but with my own spin on some of the mechanics. 
                As much as I love the classics, there are small things I've always wanted to improve, 
                so I’m redesigning certain aspects to make the experience smoother, more intuitive, and ultimately more fun. 
                <br><br>
                I’ll be introducing completely new mechanics, as well as tweaking others, to create a system that feels more engaging and enjoyable. 
                These changes reflect my personal vision for what I believe can make tabletop gaming even better.
                <br><br>
                In the long run, I’d love to make this project open-source, allowing others to contribute ideas and feedback. 
                My goal is to build a community around it, where we can all collaborate and create something truly unique together.
                <br><br>
                Hope you will have fun playing it
            </p>

            <h2>How to navigate the website</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                You will find on this website all the information you need to play this rpg, you can navigate it from the sidebar on the left
                <br><br>
                I will also create a pdf and hopefully a book version of this rules as soon as I fell like the game can be fully playable
            </p>
            <br><br><br>

            <!--introduction to the game-->
            <h1>The basics</h1>
            <br>
            <!--explain the concept of tabletop games and what is a game master-->
            <p>
                explain the concept of a game master and blablabla, basic stuff
            </p>
            <br>
            <!--how to create a player and where to find stuff, 
            also how to move in this website-->
            <p>
                the first thing you will need is to create your player, you can find more information in the next pharagraph, 
                how you do it will depend on which campaign type you want to play and you have to decide that with the game master
                <br>
                You can download a pdf <a href="#">here</a> or we have a prepared spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DpY_pUEMf0f6sjY3ve5i4_FIyBo7v2e42wMJyJkg8bY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>, 
                or perhaps just write down you stats on a piece of paper, it doesn't really matter where, you just need to be able to access those information fast.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!--explain the basic dice throwing mechanic-->
            <p>
                say that instead of using a d20 you throw a number of unknown dice based on your modifier
            </p>
            <br>
            <!--tell where to find more information on other mechanics-->
            <p>
                for example combat, playing card games or idk, other stuff
            </p>
            <br><br>

            <h1>Character creation</h1>
            <br>
            <p>
                <!--explain that there are multiple way of creating a character, 
                someone prefer to start from choosing a race and a class, other people from an idea of the background and 
                someone else will get inspiration from tv series etc... they're all good methods and you need to find your preferred one-->
                choose a race <br>
                we don't have classes (i still have to decide) <br>
                we don't have levels (i still have to decide, or it depends from the class) <br>
