                Every material has a hardness variable, from a wood stick (1), up to whatever fantasy material you want to create, 
                for reference something like an iron sword ig would be like 4 or 5, I'm gonna study this better later on
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you hit a weapon with a lower hardness than your weapon, you can make a throw, I still have to decide how it works, 
                but you can attempt to break the other weapon. 
                Of coure the more difference there is the more is gonna be easy to break it. <br>
                Also let's say that if you hit a weapon that has a hardness major than 4 compared to your weapon than you have to make a saving throw to 
                not break you own weapon or something
