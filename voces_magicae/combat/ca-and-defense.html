            <br>
            <p>
                CA not only determine if you hit your attack or not, but also determine where you hit <br><br>
                <i>maybe I should do something like that you have to say where you want to hit before?</i> <br><br>
                
                Let's say that someone have a +3 arm, +1 shield, +2 sword parry, +2dex, +10
                If your to hit attack it's less than 10, you're gonna miss entirely, if it's 11 or twelve, the other guy is gonna dodge, 
                if it's 13, 14 or 15 it's gonna parry with his sword or with shield, the one parrying can choose what he want to use, case of the sword check <a href="weapon-materials.html">weapon materials</a> to try and break his weapon, 
                if it's 16, 17, or 18 you're gonna hit his armor, in this case check <a href="damage-type.html">damage type</a> to see if you can damage trough armor; 
                If it's more you're gonna hit entirely
