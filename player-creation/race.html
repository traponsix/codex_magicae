                    based on the type of the campaign you get a number of race creation point that you can spend on your race,
                    Usually this number is <i>-insert number- </i> But you can change it based on how strong you want your players to be
                    <br>
                    You can spend your RCP for various thing that you're gonna see in this article and blablabla

                        Some traits are <a href="/voces_magicae/player-creation/race.html#required_traits">required</a>, which means that you have to take an option for each one of those traits,
                        other traits are <a href="/voces_magicae/player-creation/race.html#optional_traits">optional</a>, which mean that you can take or not that specific trait, based on how many RCP you have or want to spend

                    You can't go at less then 0 RCP, but you are not obligated to use all the one's you have <br>
                    (this doesn't mean that you can change your race attributes during the campaign)

                <p>
                    The first thing you should choose is how tall your race should be on medium,
                    after you do that you can calculate the value of your race using <a href="character-size.html">this function</a>.
                    <br>
                    The major advantage of using this method is that you don't have any limitation on the size you want to play,
                    you could literally play ants as well ass creatures that can eat entire planets
                    <br><br>
                    The most commond one are the following:

                        Medium (0) = 1,5m - 2,2m <br>
                        big (1) = 2,2m - 3,2m <br>
                        Huge (2) = 3,2m - 4,8m <br>
                        Enormous (3) = 4,8m - 7m <br>

                    PLEASE NOTE: <br>
                    To calculate size value use the larger, single straitgh value,
                    for example if a character is more large or long than it is height, do not use height, use the larger value
                </p> <br>
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>
                        You will get a +1 at your ToHitTrow every difference in size, 
                        if your target is bigger than you; <br>
                        at the same time you get a -1 for every difference in size 
                        if the target is smaller than you 
                    </p>

                    Movement speed change based on the size, but I still have to figure out the equation
